Create a JSON object of type Listing (provided below) based on the following text for each of the following items. 

ANY FIELD YOU CAN'T FIND HAS TO BE RETURNED AS null. startDate and endDate must be in the format of a date, NOT mins.

Make sure all the fields you return are double-quoted, INCLUDING THE VALUES! Any values that contain texts/strings MUST also be double-quoted. Numbers should not be double-quoted.

Also, after the last value in the JSON object, NEVER put a comma! NEVER! You must make sure the returned object is properly formatted JSON.

Make sure the last character before the closing bracket is a double-quote, always.

This is really important!

startDate means the date you can enter the apartment from.

## ENTER DATA HERE ##

type ListingCardData = {
  startDate: string
  endDate: string
  roomCount: number
  area: number
  price: number
  floorNumber: number
  street: string
  neighborhood: string
};

Do not try to translate the text, leave street name in hebrew. I don't care about the content. Just give me the final object as output and nothing else.
