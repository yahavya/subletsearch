Create a JSON object of type Listing (provided below) based on the following text for each of the following items. 

ANY FIELD YOU CAN'T FIND HAS TO BE RETURNED AS null. startDate and endDate must be in the format of a date, NOT mins.

Only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation.

## ENTER DATA HERE ##

״כניסה״ usually means the startDate.

[{
  "startDate": "sublet start date DD/MM format, return 'היום' if not found",
  "endDate": "sublet end date, DD/MM format, return null if not found",
  "roomCount": number of rooms in the apartment (should be a number),
  "area": apartment size in square meters (should be a number),
  "price": rental cost (should be a number), if not found, return 1
  "floorNumber": what floor is the apartment on (should be a number),
  "street": "what street is the apartment on, must be translated to hebrew, maximum length of 3 words",
  "neighborhood": "what neighborhood is the apartment in, must be translated to hebrew, for example: 'יפו, פלורנטין, הצפון הישן, דיזנגוף', maximum length of 3 words"
}]

Do not try to translate the text to English. If the listing is in English, translate it to Hebrew. I don't care about the content. Just give me the final object as output and nothing else.

DON'T MAKE STUFF UP. IF YOU CAN'T FIND A CERTAIN FIELD, RETURN IT AS null.
