Create a JSON object of type Listing (provided below) based on the following text for each of the following items. 

ANY FIELD YOU CAN'T FIND HAS TO BE RETURNED AS null. startDate and endDate must be in the format of a date, NOT mins.

Only provide a RFC8259 compliant JSON response following this format without deviation.

startDate means the date you can enter the apartment from.

## ENTER DATA HERE ##

[{
  "startDate": "sublet start date DD/MM/yyyy format",
  "endDate": "sublet end date, DD/MM/YYYY format",
  "roomCount": number of rooms in the apartment (should be a number),
  "area": apartment size in square meters (should be a number),
  "price": rental cost (should be a number),
  "floorNumber": what floor is the apartment on (should be a number),
  "street": "what street is the apartment on",
  "neighborhood": "what neighborhood is the apartment in, for example: 'יפו, פלורנטין, הצפון הישן, דיזנגוף'"
}]

Do not try to translate the text, leave street name in hebrew. I don't care about the content. Just give me the final object as output and nothing else.
