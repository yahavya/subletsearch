Create a JSON object of type Listing (provided below) based on the following text for each of the following items, only if ״מחפש״ or ״מחפשת״  doesn't appear in the post. For the post date, use today's date. 

When you see "END", that means this is the end of the current listing and you should reset the fields for the next listing.

## ENTER DATA HERE ##

type ListingCardData = {
  id: number
  city: "Tel Aviv"
  type: "Sublet"
  postDate: string
  startDate: string
  endDate?: string
  imageUrls: FacebookImageUrl[]
  roomCount: number
  area?: number
  price?: number
  floorNumber?: number
  street?: string
  neighborhood?: string
};

Do not try to translate the text, leave street name in hebrew. I don't care about the content. Just give me the final object as output and nothing else.
