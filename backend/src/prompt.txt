Create a JSON object of type Listing (provided below) based on the following text for each of the following item, only if the word ״מחפש״ or ״מחפשת״  does not appear in the post. For the post date, use today's date. 

When you see "END", that means this is the end of the current listing and you should reset the fields for the next listing.

## ENTER DATA HERE ##

type ListingCardData = {
  id: number;
  city: "Tel Aviv";
  postDate: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate?: string;
  roomCount: number;
  area?: number;
  price?: number;
  floorNumber?: number;
  street?: string;
  neighborhood?: string;
};

Do not try to translate the text. I don't care about the content. Just give me the final object as output and nothing else.
